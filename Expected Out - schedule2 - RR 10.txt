Start running Process {Id='P2', Arrival Time=1, Burst Time=3, Current Time=1}
P2 finished at time 4. Its waiting time is 0
Current average waiting time: 0.0
Start running Process {Id='P3', Arrival Time=2, Burst Time=1, Current Time=4}
P3 finished at time 5. Its waiting time is 2
Current average waiting time: 1.0
Start running Process {Id='P4', Arrival Time=2, Burst Time=7, Current Time=5}
Stop running Process {Id='P4, Current Time=10}
Start running Process {Id='P5', Arrival Time=3, Burst Time=4, Current Time=10}
P5 finished at time 14. Its waiting time is 7
Current average waiting time: 3.0
Start running Process {Id='P1', Arrival Time=4, Burst Time=5, Current Time=14}
P1 finished at time 19. Its waiting time is 10
Current average waiting time: 4.75
Start running Process {Id='P4', Arrival Time=2, Burst Time=7, Current Time=19}
P4 finished at time 21. Its waiting time is 12
