Start running Process {Id='P2', Arrival Time=0, Burst Time=5, Current Time=0}
P2 finished at time 5. Its waiting time is 0
Current average waiting time: 0.0
Start running Process {Id='P4', Arrival Time=3, Burst Time=1, Current Time=5}
P4 finished at time 6. Its waiting time is 2
Current average waiting time: 1.0
Start running Process {Id='P3', Arrival Time=3, Burst Time=1, Current Time=6}
P3 finished at time 7. Its waiting time is 3
Current average waiting time: 1.6666666666666667
Start running Process {Id='P1', Arrival Time=0, Burst Time=10, Current Time=7}
P1 finished at time 17. Its waiting time is 7
