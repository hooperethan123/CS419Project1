Start running Process {Id='P1', Arrival Time=0, Burst Time=10, Current Time=0}
P1 finished at time 10. Its waiting time is 0
Current average waiting time: 0.0
Start running Process {Id='P4', Arrival Time=3, Burst Time=1, Current Time=10}
P4 finished at time 11. Its waiting time is 7
Current average waiting time: 3.5
Start running Process {Id='P3', Arrival Time=3, Burst Time=1, Current Time=11}
P3 finished at time 12. Its waiting time is 8
Current average waiting time: 5.0
Start running Process {Id='P2', Arrival Time=0, Burst Time=5, Current Time=12}
P2 finished at time 17. Its waiting time is 12
Current average waiting time: 6.75
Final Time: 17
End of simulation.
